# Exploratory Data Analysis of Ultra-Marathon using Python Pandas

In this Project we take a look at an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) portfolio project within Python Pandas. Everything is coded within Jupyter Notebook and the data is sourced from Kaggle.
# Data Source : 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aiaiaidavid/the-big-dataset-of-ultra-marathon-running/discussion/420633
# Python Libraries used: 
 1. Pandas
 2. Seaborn

# Questions Considered for this Data Analysis:
1.Differnece in speed for 50k and 50mi for male and female.
2.what age groups are the best in the 50m Race(20+ Races min)(show 5)
3.what age groups are the worst in the 50m Race(10+ Races min)(show 5)
4.Seasons for the data-which season has slower average speed.
5. Distribution plot for average speed in 50miles race length.
6.Scatterplot and Violinplot for average speed for different gender for both 50kms and 50miles race length.

In this Exploratory Data Analysis I have used Marathon data and analyzed the 2020 US Marathon races for race length of 50 miles and 50kms.
1.As a first step I have Cleaned up the data and created a data frame consisting of only US data for year 2020 and race length 50kms and 50miles.

2. Further I have removed the unused columns in our analysis in new data frame and modified the column names as required, removed the duplicates and null values.
3.Created few new columns using existing data required for the analysis.


Below you can see few plots that are created to answer the questions.
